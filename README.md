The Java class `SubsetSum` accepts two inputs:

```
int[] input, int sum
```

The class provides two public methods:

1) Returns two addends that total sum, or an empty int[] if no solution is found:

 ```
int [] findPair(int[] input, int sum)
```

and

2) Returns an int[] containing addends that total sum, or an empty int[] if no solution is found

```
int [] findAnySolution(int[] input, int sum)
```


These were the instructions and example inputs/outputs provided:


```
1. Give an array of numbers, return 2 numbers that has sum of a given number, or empty array if no valid answer, for example

int[] findNumbers(int[] input, int sum)

input = {1, 2, 3, 7, 10}, sum = 17, result: {7, 10}
input = {4, 6, 8, 9}, sum = 3, result: {}

2. Instead of 2 numbers, return n numbers that has sum of a given number, e.g.

input = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}, sum = 10, result: {1, 2, 3, 4}
input = {2, 4, 6, 25}, sum = 25, result: {25}
input = {2, 4, -6, 24, 34}, sum = 0, result: {2, 4, -6}

In the case of multiple solutions, only need to return the first one found.
```

Design decisions:

1. The class uses a static method since there is no need to store state or create multiple instances.

2. Duplicate entries in the input set are filtered out.

3. I used Streams and lambdas where they made the code cleaner and more readable. In some cases (loops requiring indexes) they would have provided no improvement so I used traditional for-loops. 

4. I chose to apply a dynamic approach to avoid O(n^2) performance from calculating all possible subsets using recursion. This solution provides performance on the order of O(n).

5. The public API returns the subset with the elements sorted from smallest to largest.
